# Exploratory-Data-Analysis-with-Python
## Overview

The Titanic dataset is a classic dataset often used for machine learning and data analysis projects. This EDA project aims to explore the dataset, preprocess the data, and build a logistic regression model to predict survival on the Titanic.

## Analysis Steps

1. **Handling Missing Values**:
   - Checked for missing values in the dataset.
   - Imputed missing age data using the mean

2. **Converting Categorical Variables**:
   - Converted categorical variables to dummy variables for model building.

3. **Logistic Regression Model**:
   - Built a logistic regression model to predict survival on the Titanic dataset.

### Model Performance
- **Accuracy Score**: 0.7902621722846442

## Files Included

- Jupyter Notebook containing the Python code for EDA and model building.
- Dataset file ( train.csv.test.csv).

## Dependencies

- Pandas
- Numpy
- Seaborn
- Matplotlib
- Scikit_learn
